# Goal
I am designing this website to showcase the work I have done so far and allow an easy integration for my future aceivements.
I will be designing it using react objects functions which will make iterative improvements a piece of cake.

# Behavior
A single page website with my own design that has:
    1) Who I am --> Intro/vision
    2) Projects --> 
    4) Goals --> 
    5) Contact --> will use the send_email API that I 
        previously created

# Test
1) successfully integrates [rojects as posts (project_post)
